			<h2>The Brewery</h2>
			<img scr="#" alt="brewery logo" >
			<p>Luckily the smallest Island in the world to host a rugby tournament is also the smallest island in the world to have its own Brewery. The Colonsay Brewery has been supporting the Rugby festival since day one, despite having to make major structural investments into building their bar (it has be know to turn into a dance podium for the locals). The Brewery serves their IPA, 80/- and Blonde all weekend, significantly contributing to the quality of the rugby played.</p>
